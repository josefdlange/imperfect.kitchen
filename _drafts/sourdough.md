I hesitated a long time before adding a recipe for sourdough to the site. Some of the process is a little magic, and so codifying it in a simple recipe is inherently difficult.

This recipe assumes you have a healthy, 100%-hydrated sourdough starter in your arsenal. Don't have one? King Arthur Flour has a great guide on starting one [here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe).
