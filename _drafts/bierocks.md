    - Add the **onions** and **cabbage**, and allow to sauté for _4 minutes_.
    - Add the **caraway seeds**, **garlic**, and **fresh dill**, and cook for another _fifteen minutes_, until everything is nice and tender.

        - Pull up the edges and join together into a little purse, then pinch it all closed.
        - Set down the bun, seam side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
        - 'break: Ensure that all our buns are **two inches** apart.'
    - Cover the bierocks, loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow to rest for _20 minutes_.
    - Preheat your **oven** to **375°F**.
    - When your bierocks are nice and puffy, brush them with some melted butter and **bake** for _20-25 minutes_.

Bierocks are a great little German yeasted pastry stuffed with flavorful beef, onion, and cabbage. Though its name's similarity to the German for beer (_bier_) is only a coincidence, I can guarantee these will go well with a nice crisp lager or pilsner.
