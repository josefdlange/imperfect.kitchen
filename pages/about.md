Imperfect Kitchen is a celebration of the home cook. It's written by a home cook, in fact. [Joey Lange](https://twitter.com/josefdlange) is a self-described home cook -- and some other weird things like a software engineer and a gardner.

The idea behind Imperfect Kitchen is to cut through the filler and get right to the good stuff: the food. You can expect recipes that are totally possible at home (even if you don't think so at first) and some nice photos of the food to get you drooling.
