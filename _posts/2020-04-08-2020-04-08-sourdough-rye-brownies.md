total_time: 2-3 hours
active_time: 25 minutes
yield: too many (?) brownies
difficulty: Easy
equipment:
- 9"x13" brownie/cake pan
- Bowl(s)
- Saucepan
ingredients:
  sourdough starter (discard): 125g
  rye flour: 205g
  eggs: 5
  white sugar: 1 cup, divided
  bittersweet chocolate (chips, chunks, etc): 425g
  butter: 3/4 cup
  vanilla: 1/2 tsp
  brown sugar: 1 cup
  cocoa powder: 3/4 cup
  baking soda: 1/2 tsp
  salt: 1/2 tsp
  instant espresso: 1/2 tsp
  flaky salt (optional): a few pinches
directions:
- Combine the **sourdough starter**, **rye flour**, and **eggs**, plus *1/2 cup* of
  the **white sugar**. Set aside for **1-2 hours**.
- 'break: When the **starter mixture** has nearly finished resting, preheat your oven
  to 325Â°F and grease your baking pan with **butter**, then continue.'
- Melt the **butter** and **chocolate chips/chunks** together on low heat (or in the
  microwave, zapping in short intervals and stirring between them). Once fully melted,
  stir in the **vanilla extract**.
- Combine the **starter mixture**, **chocolate mixture**, and the remaining dry ingredients
  (the other **1/2 cup** of **white sugar**, **brown sugar**, **cocoa powder**, **baking
  soda**, **salt**, and **instant espresso**), to make a **batter**.
- Spread the **batter** evenly in your **greased pan**, and sprinkle with **flaky
  salt** if using.
- Bake for **30-40 minutes**, until you can gently push in and remove a paring knife
  cleanly.
notes:
- While I don't consider myself&mdash;and probably never will&mdash;expert enough
  to post a recipe for making sourdough bread itself, I think I will continue to explore
  uses for excess starter and post them on this site.

I recently revived a long-hibernated sourdough starter colony. The one thing that bugs me about keeping one is all the wasted starter as you cut it and feed it. This recipe is a fantastic use of that excess.
