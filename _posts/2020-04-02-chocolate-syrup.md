Chocolate. Syrup. Why say anything more?

<!--more-->

## Equipment
- Saucepan
- Whisk
- Squeeze bottle or jar

## Ingredients
- **1.5 cups** water
- **1.5 cups** white sugar
- **1 cup** cocoa powder (normal, not dutch process for this)
- **a dash** salt
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract

## Directions
1. Combine everything **except the vanilla** in the saucepan.
2. Bring to a simmer while whisking gently.
3. When it thickens up, remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla.
4. Once cool, transfer to your squeeze bottle or jar and store in the fridge.

## Notes
- This will keep in the fridge for at least a week -- if you can make it last that long.
