image: lox.jpg
total_time: 4 days
active_time: 40 minutes
yields: 1-4lb of lox
difficulty: Easy
equipment:
- Plastic wrap
- Shallow baking dish
- Something heavy
- Sharp knife
ingredients:
  good salmon: 1-4lb
  kosher salt: 1/3 cup
  sugar: 1/2 cup
  fresh ground pepper: 2 tsp
  juniper berries: 3-5
  fresh dill, finely chopped: 1-2 cups
  red pepper flakes: a pinch
  grated raw beets (optional): 2-3 tbsp
directions:
- Trim the salmon, remove pin bones, and cut into two pieces as close in size and
  shape as possible. Place one piece skin-down on a large piece of plastic wrap
- Combine the remaining ingredients and rub all over the salmon, evenly and liberally,
  then place the other piece on top, flesh-down, to make a "salmon sandwich"
- Tightly wrap in multiple layers of plastic wrap, place in shallow baking dish with
  somehing heavy on top of it, and put in the fridge
- 'break: For the next four days, once or twice a day, flip the salmon. If there''s
  a lot of liquid, unwrap the fish, drain the liquid, and rewrap in fresh plastic.'
- On the fourth day, remove the fish from the dish, unwrap, and rinse the _outsides_
  only (leave them sandwiched together).
- Pull the pieces of fish apart and brush off the excess rub (keeping as much as you
  wish for aesthetic purposes)
- Slice thin pieces on a bias and serve.
notes:
- __Fresh salmon may contain tapeworm larvae which are not killed by the salt cure__.
  It is safer to buy commercially-frozen or previously-commercially-frozen fish; that
  freezing process _does_ kill the larvae.
- I recommend fish on the fattier end of the spectrum -- pictured above is some Sockeye
  from here in WA.
- The lox should last about five days in the refrigerator -- if you are patient enough
  not to eat it all.

This delicious cured salmon is best served atop a bagel schmeared with cream cheese. Have it Sunday morning with a nice cup of coffee.
