total_time: 60 minutes
active_time: 60 minutes
yield: 4 servings
difficulty: Moderate
equipment:
    - Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed pot
    - Stock pot for pasta
ingredients:
    olive oil: 1/4 cup
    shallots, sliced very thin: 6
    garlic, thinly sliced: 4 cloves
    garlic, minced: 1 clove
    salt & pepper: ''
    red pepper flakes: 1 tsp
    anchovy paste: 1 tbsp
    tomato paste: 3/4 cup
    buccacini: 10 oz
    parsley: 1 cup chopped
directions:
    - Heat **dutch oven** over **medium-low** heat.
    - Add **shallots** and **sliced garlic**, and season with **salt & pepper**, and cook until shallots are soft and caramelized, about **forty-five minutes**.
    - Drop your pasta in extremely salty water, and cook according to the instructions. Pull it a minute or two early, so the pasta is __very__ _al dente_. **Save at least a cup of the pasta water!**
    - While the pasta cooks, turn up the heat on the shallots to somewhere between **medium** and **medium-high** heat for about **five minutes** while stirring, to get some fond to develop at the bottom of your pan and to darken the edges of some of the shallots. 
    - Add the **red pepper flakes**, **anchovy paste**, and **tomato paste**, and cook about **three minutes** until very fragrant. By now, your pasta should be ready.
    - Strain your pasta and add **1 cup** of the pasta water to the shallots.
    - Cook **three to five minutes**, deglazing any bits of the sauce stuck to your pan.
    - Add the pasta back to the sauce and turn to **low** to simmer and finish the pasta. Stir occasionally.
    - Combine the **parsley** and **minced garlic**, and season with **salt & pepper**, and some more **red pepper flakes**, to taste.
    - Divide pasta across **four bowls** and garnish with **parsley mixture**.

    - Alison's recipe has you pack up half of the shallot mixture for a later use, but I just used the entirety of it for this recipe. I really loved the full flavor from using it all.
    - You can easily take this sauce into the puttanesca territory by increasing the amount of anchovy paste. I love when things are that funky, but it's not for everyone. You could also omit the anchovy paste entirely.

I immediately put this recipe at the top of my list. Rich, caramelized shallots coupled with funky tomato paste and anchovies make for a loud dish worthy of any menu, at home or in the fanciest of restaurants.
