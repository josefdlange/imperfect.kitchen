total_time: 45 min
active_time: 45 min
yield: 4 servings
difficulty: Easy
equipment:
- Saucepan
- Immersion blender (optional)
ingredients:
  yellow onion: 1
  processed tomatoes (chopped, puréed, whatever): 1 28 oz can
  butter: 1/2 c (1 stick)
directions:
- Peel the onion and remove the tip and root end. Try to keep _just enough_ root that it
  keeps together. Cut it in half along the meridian.
- Combine tomatoes, onions, and butter in a saucepan on medium. Bring to a gentle simmer and turn down to medium.
- Cook, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes (or more; more time is better of course, but 45 minutes will do the trick).
- Remove onion pieces. (_I like to purée these onion pieces with some balsamic and
  herbs to make a sort-of bruschetta out of them. It's not gonna blow your mind but
  it's tasty enough_.)
- If you've used anything more, uh, whole than puréed tomatoes, either cook longer to get
  them to disintegrate, or use an immersion blender to purée (after removing onions)
notes:
- My favorite use for this sauce is to drown some simple pasta in it. Like, use way more sauce than is reasonable. Almost like a thick soup that happens to have pasta in it. Doesn't need to be anything fancy. Would also be great with meatballs, but the butter content makes for a _very_ rich combo there.

Seriously. This is almost too simple. It feels like cheating.
